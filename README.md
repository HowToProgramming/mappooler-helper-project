# mappooler-helper-project
The very first project I've done myself, this project is for mappoolers in osu tourneys, basically helping about picking and suggesting the maps for the mappool in osu! tourney

Well, this is a little hard and slow to process because this is just the very first project and very first version I've done
I don't want you to waste the time reading this, so let's go to the first thing you need to know !

--- Login Phase ---
- First time that you've entered this client, you need to provide the data of the "Mappool Selector Sheet" which is like the "Sample Mappool Sheet"
"Sample Mappool Sheet" can be found here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_Af-h2YmlFavf9Eoq0iUE6OErhDqD0nPBhOJyxnrHU/edit?usp=sharing>

How to get your own Spreadsheet which is like the "Sample Mappool Sheet" ?
- You click "File"
- Then click "Make a copy"
That's Easy ! You've got your own Mappool Spreadsheet !
Ok ! so you've got your own Mappool Spreadsheet, what to do next ?
- Make the sheet public (but you must share only the people in your team !)
- Open the client
Then you have to provide something into the client ! I'll explain what is what
Spreadsheet Link : Your Mappool Spreadsheet link
Username : Your osu! username
Mappooler Amount : How many people in your mappool selection team
Sheet Index : You should count from the first page of the spreadsheet as 0 and so on until the page you want to do the mappool
Max Score Rating : This one is like the suitable rating, just discuss with your team about what is the number that shows you're most strongly support the map (to be honest I don't know how to explain it so I may edit this later)
After providing datas, now you're at the last step to be a mappooler !

What can this project do ?
1. Add the maps to the suggestion
- Click "Add Map"
- Provide "The beatmap id" (the last 7 digits of the map link)
- Type of the map
- What you would like to say about the map
After that, click "Add Map" at the below of the Entry
You can provide the data of the new Map and so on
If you're done adding maps, click "Add All Maps" and those maps will appear in the spreadsheet !

2. Vote the map
- Click "Vote"
- Select the map to Vote and enter the Voting score
- Click "Vote Map"
- If you have maps to Vote more, do it again
If you're finished, click "Vote All Maps" and your score will appear in the spreadsheet !

3. Pick the map
- Click "Pick"
- Select the map to pick, click "Pick this map"
- If you have maps to Pick more, do it again
If you're finished, click "Pick All Maps" and everything you've picked will appear in the spreadsheet at the pick side !
